I have written this code with Internet support.
To Run this project first create "uploads" folder in project out side,that folder stored the uploading files.
Registed user only allowed goes to the file uploading page. 
I have create User Table Store user information and encrypted passwords.
I have used PHP Data Object(PDO)Method.It provides a more consistent and secure way to interract with databases compared to MYSQL.
The binding parameters in a prepared statement, specifying the data type helps in proper handling and escaping of the data to prevent SQL injection.
And I used bindParam method This method binds the parameters of the prepared statement to the specified variables.
I have create Uploads Table store information and  including the filename and associated user.
I have done the Log table including the uploader's IP address,filename,and upload timestamp in this project.
PHP provides the IP address of the client making the request. This information is often used for tracking user activity, security purposes, and customization of content based on the user's location or network.
The Time stamp data type was used to store date and time values. It can be set to automatically update to the current timestamp when a record is inserted or updated.
